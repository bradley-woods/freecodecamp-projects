        <h2 id="headline">Timeline of Atanasoff's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1903</strong> - Atanasoff was born in Hamilton, New York to an electrical engineer and a school teacher.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1925</strong> - Atanasoff received his Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1926</strong> -  Earned a master's degree in mathematics.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930</strong> - Earned a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with his thesis, <i>The Dielectric Constant of Helium.</i> Upon completion of his doctorate, Atanasoff accepted an assistant professorship at Iowa State College in mathematics and physics.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936</strong> - Invented an analog calculator for analyzing surface geometry. At this point, he was pushing the boundaries of what gears could do and the fine mechanical tolerance required for good accuracy pushed him to consider digital solutions.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939</strong> - With the assistance of his graduate student Clifford Berry, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) was prototyped by November of that year. According to Atanasoff, several operative principles of the ABC were conceived by him during the winter of 1938 after a drive to Rock Island, Illinois.</li></ul>
        <p><i>The key ideas employed in the ABC included binary math and Boolean logic to solve up to 29 simultaneous linear equations. The ABC had no central processing unit (CPU), but was designed as an electronic device using vacuum tubes for digital computation. It also had regenerative capacitor memory that operated by a process similar to that used today in DRAM memory.</i></p>
